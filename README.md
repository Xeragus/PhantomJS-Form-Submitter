# PhantomJS-Form-Submitter
Form submitter script written using PhantomJS. The first form has one checkbox, two input fields and a submit button. Screenshots are taken in between the states, so we can test the changes. Screenshots are needed because headless browser is used. The second form has an username and password fields, with submit button at the end.
